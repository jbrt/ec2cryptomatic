Encrypt EBS volumes from AWS EC2 instances

**A serverless version of this script exists here:** https://github.com/jbrt/ec2cryptomatic-serverless

## Description

This tool let you :
- Encrypt all the EBS volumes for an instance
- Duplicate all the source tags to the target
- Apply DeleteOnTermination flag if needs
- Preserve the original volume or not as an option (thank to @cobaltjacket)
- Start each instance after encrypting is complete (thank to @dshah22)

For your information, the workflow used to encrypt an EBS volume is:
- Take a snapshot from the original volume
- Create a new volume encrypted from that snapshot
- Swap volumes
- Delete source unencrypted volumes (if requested)

## Note about version 2.x

Since version 1, EC2Cryptomatic was coded in Python. This version 2 is a 
complete rewriting of this tool in Golang.

Why Golang instead of Python ? Principally because of fun and for training for 
the author on that language.

Golang is also a good option for a CLI tool like this (more portable than 
Python).

Python version is still available at git tag 1.2.4.
